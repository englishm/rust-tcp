• Publishing
• More interface for Async ‒ ability to send/recv one thing, framed (so we don't have to create bunch of vecs all the time)
• Fix of compilation and features ‒ examples don't build without all the features
• Share some bits of the examples, maybe better error handling in them
• Logging?
• Some error chaining (no such file or directory isn't very telling when /dev/net/tun is missing)

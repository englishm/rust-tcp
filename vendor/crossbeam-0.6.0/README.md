This crate provides a set of tools for concurrent programming:

* Atomics
    * `ArcCell<T>` is a shared mutable `Arc<T>` pointer.
    * `AtomicCell<T>` is equivalent to `Cell<T>`, except it is also thread-safe.
    * `AtomicConsume` allows reading from primitive atomic types with "consume" ordering.

* Data structures
    * `deque` module contains work-stealing deques for building task schedulers.
    * `MsQueue<T>` and `SegQueue<T>` are simple concurrent queues.
    * `TreiberStack<T>` is a lock-free stack.

* Synchronization
    * `channel` module contains multi-producer multi-consumer channels for message passing.
    * `ShardedLock<T>` is like `RwLock<T>`, but sharded for faster concurrent reads.
    * `WaitGroup` enables threads to synchronize the beginning or end of some computation.

* Memory management
    * `epoch` module contains epoch-based garbage collection.

* Utilities
    * `CachePadded<T>` pads and aligns a value to the length of a cache line.
    * `scope()` can spawn threads that borrow local variables from the stack. 

## Crates

Some of the tools live in the main `crossbeam` crate, and some are re-exported
from smaller subcrates:

* [`crossbeam-channel`](crossbeam-channel)
  provides multi-producer multi-consumer channels for message passing.
* [`crossbeam-deque`](crossbeam-deque)
  provides work-stealing deques, which are primarily intended for building task schedulers.
* [`crossbeam-epoch`](crossbeam-epoch)
  provides epoch-based garbage collection for building concurrent data structures.
* [`crossbeam-utils`](crossbeam-utils)
  provides miscellaneous utilities for concurrent programming:

Take a look at [src/lib.rs](src/lib.rs) to see what goes where.

There is one more experimental subcrate that is not yet included in `crossbeam`:

* [`crossbeam-skiplist`](crossbeam-skiplist)
  provides concurrent maps and sets based on lock-free skip lists.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
crossbeam = "0.6"
```

Next, add this to your crate:

```rust
extern crate crossbeam;
```

## Compatibility

The minimum supported Rust version is 1.26.

Features available in `no_std` environments:

* `AtomicCell<T>`
* `AtomicConsume`
* `CachePadded<T>`
* `epoch` (nightly Rust only)

## Contributing

Crossbeam welcomes contribution from everyone in the form of suggestions, bug reports,
pull requests, and feedback. ðŸ’›

If you're looking for things to do, there are several easy ways to get started:

* Found a bug or have a feature request?
  [Tell us](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues/new)!
* Issues and PRs labeled with
  [feedback wanted](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22feedback+wanted%22+)
  need feedback from users and contributors.
* Issues labeled with
  [good first issue](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  are relatively easy starter issues.

#### RFCs

We also have the [RFCs](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/rfcs) repository for more
high-level discussion. It is a place where we brainstorm ideas and propose
substantial changes to Crossbeam.

Feel free to participate in any open 
[issues](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
or
[pull requests](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)!

#### Learning resources

If you'd like to learn more about concurrency and non-blocking data structures, there's a
list of learning resources in our [wiki](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/rfcs/wiki),
which includes related blog posts, papers, videos, and other similar projects.

Another good place to visit is [merged RFCs](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/rfcs/tree/master/text).
They contain elaborate descriptions and rationale for features we've introduced to
Crossbeam, but note that some of the written information is now out of date.

#### Conduct

The Crossbeam project adheres to the
[Rust Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
This describes the minimum behavior expected from all contributors.
